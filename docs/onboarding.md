# Onboarding

Hello, human! Droid here to walk you through my setup process. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Configure API Key

### Description
You'll need an OpenAI API key to authenticate your requests with OpenAI's services.

### Instructions to get OpenAI API Key
1. Navigate to the [OpenAI API Keys Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2. Sign in to your OpenAI account. If you don't have one, you'll need to create it first.
3. After signing in, click the **Create new secret key** button.
4. Copy the generated API key.
5. Enter the copied API key when I prompt you to do so.

## Step 2: Select Default Model

Choose a default model from the available options: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo` and more. The model determines my capabilities and pricing.

## Step 3: Define Prompt

A default prompt will be provided, which you can modify to suit your needs.
- Edit the prompt as required. You can add extra context or details to generate more accurate responses.
- Press `Ctrl + D` to save your changes.

## Step 4: Create or Validate Assistant
Here, you'll create or verify the existence of your assistant.

### Actions
If no assistant exists:
- I'll ask you if you want to create one. 
- If you confirm, I'll create the assistant with your provided API key.
- If you decline, the onboarding process will end, but you can run the setup anytime.

Follow these steps to effectively set me up for your project. Let's make development smoother together!
