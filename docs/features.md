ðŸ¤– Let me showcase my amazing features that will make your development experience smoother and more efficient. One thing I would like to mention is that I am as good as your input, if I miss something just be more specific and I will do magic! ðŸª„ 

## Code Analysis

I can scan through your project files and folders to read and understand your code. This allows me to make context-aware changes that fit seamlessly into your existing codebase.

Worried about bugs? Leave it to me! I automatically analyze your code to identify common issues and suggest or apply fixes, saving you time and effort. I mean with right inputs, I can do wonders!

## Test Writing

Ensuring your code functions as expected is crucial. I generate comprehensive test cases based on your current code structure to help maintain high-quality code.

## File Creation

Need new files or components? I create them adhering to your project's existing patterns and conventions, ensuring consistency across your codebase.
